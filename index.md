## Welcome our genre style transfer results page!

Below you will find some generated samples from all models, i.e. the normal CycleGAN, CycleGAN with timbre discriminator (T) and CycleGAN with both timbre- and composition discriminator (TC). You will find both cherry-picked and random generations, and their corresponding original song. Please enjoy! :)
